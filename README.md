# risk-game-project
A game modeled after the RISK: Game of Thrones board game, made using Unity.

I implemented this game through skills learned primarily in my elective CSCI 4439: Game Programming. Starting with the basic concepts, I was able to create a foundation for the game. Although relatively simple in scope, I found myself investing a lot more time than I expected into this project to make all the parts work together. Particularly, scripts related to the function of clicking and turn actions required a lot of testing and logic to nail down.

The game uses a map of the RISK: Game of Thrones game with polygon colliders to determine where the player is clicking. The game has a simple turn progression, simple actions, and a basic AI that acts randomly so that the player can have opponents to play against.
